<h1>A Professional Programming Journey</h1>
<p>When I was young maybe 9 or 10 when I was introduced to computers. I would play around with computers, 
    after sometime I became very interested in programming
   several years ago.  I study the concept of programming. There is no limit to coding, I believe programming 
   is the future. The posibilities of being 
   an excellent programer is hard work and dedication. Here are some images of the programming possibilities.</p>

   <p>Google Glass was a big accomplishment in technology development. However I believe that it wasn't as 
       successful
       for the people who created it as they hoped it to be. Basically because it was the phone recreated 
       all over again.</p>
    <h1>Biomimetic Worm Bot</h1>
    <img src="images/worm-robot.jpg" height="200" width="400">
    <p>this creepy-crawly bot is helping both roboticists and neuroscientists better understand a type of motion 
        called peristalsis — or movement through contracting and expanding of muscle. While this kind of movement 
        is not unique to earth-worms (humans, in fact, do it when swallowing), the ability to propel and maneuver 
        their bodies through tight spaces with it is. To study this motion, the lab created the CMMWorm 
        (Compliant Modular Mesh Worm) — a soft robot with a Lego-like capability to have segments detached and 
        rearranged. Researchers told Gizmodo that they hope this kind of soft robot could be useful in situations 
        as small as medical endoscopies and as large as investigating blocked pipes.</p>
    <h1>Facial-detecting systems</h1>
    <img src="images/Facial-Tech.jpg" height="200" width="400">
    <p>Facial recognition has existed for decades, but only now is it accurate enough to be used in secure 
        financial transactions and other sensible matters.
            Face-tracking technology is expanding quickly in China. Both surveillance and convenience play a key 
            part in the increasing popularity of this arguably invasive tech. This new development might transform 
            everything from policing to the way people interact every day with banks, stores, and transportation 
            services.
            
            Face++, a face-detection software, is already being used in several popular apps. It is possible to 
            transfer money through Alipay, a mobile payment app, using only your face as credentials. Meanwhile, 
            Didi, China’s equivalent to Lyft or Uber, uses the Face++ software to let passengers confirm that the 
            person picking them up is a legitimate driver. Local governments are using the same software to identify 
            suspected criminals in video from surveillance cameras, which are omnipresent there.
            
            Now the company Baidu is developing a system that lets people pick up rail tickets by showing their 
            face. They are also already working with the government of Wuzhen, a historic tourist destination, to 
            provide access to many of its attractions without a ticket. This involves scanning tens of thousands of 
            faces in a database to find a match, which Baidu says it can do with 99 percent accuracy.</p>
