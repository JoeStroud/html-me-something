<h1>A Professional Programming Journey</h1>
<p>When I was young maybe 9 or 10 when I was introduced to computers. I would play around with computers, after sometime I became very interested in programming
   several years ago.  I study the concept of programming. There is no limit to coding, I believe programming is the future. The posibilities of being 
   an excellent programer is hard work and dedication. Here are some images of the programming possibilities.</p>

   <p>Google Glass was a big accomplishment in technology development. However I believe that it wasn't as successful
       for the people who created it as they hoped it to be. Basically because it was the phone recreated all over again.</p>
